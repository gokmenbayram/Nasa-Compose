# Nasa-Compose

This application contains images of three different Mars vehicles along with the API provided by [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/). It is mainly developed using Jetpack Compose and clean architecture.

Link to the [App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)

## Base Structure

- **Presentation Layer(UI Layer):** You build these elements using Views or Jetpack Compose functions. State holders (such as ViewModel classes) that hold data, expose it to the UI, and handle logic.

- **Data Layer:** The data layer of an contains the business logic. (Data Source, Repository etc.)

> **Note:** You can put the domain layer between the Presentation layer and the Data layer.

- **Di:** Contains related modules for dependency injection.

- **Service:** It contains the network services for the api.

- **Db:** Contains local database services.
